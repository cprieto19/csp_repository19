        My name is Christian Prieto and I am a Junior at Damien High School. Outside of School, I enjoy playing 
       and watching soccer, as well as buying and reselling sneakers. I have also started to get into sneaker
       customs where I customize shoes by painting them. I am very excited about taking this class because
       I believe that I can really learn how to code which will become very useful for me in my future, especially
       because I hope to have some sort of future in business. Besides that, I enjoy history and science and am 
       excited for my Junior year. 
       My favorite sports teams are: San Francisco 49ers, LA Lakers, Real Madrid, Mexican National Team.
       My favorite color: red.
       My favorite foods: watermelon and mango.
       My family: My Mom, My Dad, and my younger sister.
       Ronaldo or Messi?: Ronaldo.
